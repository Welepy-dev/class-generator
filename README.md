# class-generator
Generates the boilerplate of a cpp class with a default constructor, copy constructor, a assignemt overload operator and a destructor.

In order to install and run the program for your **local user** use ```chmod +x install.bash && ./install.bash```.

Once installed, source your current shell session with ```source ~/.bashrc``` or ```source ~/.zshrc``` or whatever is the current shell you are using.

You can run with ```class "classname"``` and will generate both files in your current directory.

Also ```class -f "class"``` will generate the files in a src and a inc folder.
